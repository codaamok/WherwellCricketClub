      <description>KJM sponsored Wherwell CC traveled to Medstead for a must win game to keep promotion hopes alive. Skipper R Skeates finally won the toss and elected to bat first.
Wherwell started very brightly with the traditional C Beckingham 33 and R Skeates 15 duo. Unfortunately both were caught, a theme that all Wherwell batsman would follow. M Cutts 39 and O Emslie 24 saw through the majestic spin from Medstead on a popping track, but Wherwell top/middle order faltered until No.</description>

      <description>Wherwell hosted Basingstoke in the early start game. Both teams were massively struggling for players. 10 man Wherwell won the toss and decided to field in the heat. After a explosive start Wherwell managed to finally restrict the quick run rate with the introduction on N Youngs spin 4-36. Basingstoke managed to reach 206 all out from 43 overs. A massive effort from Wherwell was required. Beckingham and Skeates went about the task with ease scoring at 6 an over in the early stages.</description>

      <description>The KJM Group Ltd sponsored Wherwell CC traveled to Tichborne Park looking to make it three wins out of the first three games.
Captain Robbie Skeates is yet to win the toss this season and was put out to field. Harry Trebert 9o 18r 2w and John Foster 9o 33r 2w got the ball rolling picking up quick early wickets bowling very well. Chances went against H Trebert with unfortunate luck against a strong partnership built up by the home team which tested Wherwell&amp;rsquo;s patience in the sun - Tichborne&amp;rsquo;s opener A Joyce scored 81 and N Connel 69.</description>
