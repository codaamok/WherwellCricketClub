      <br>
      The KJM Group Ltd sponsored Wherwell CC traveled to Tichborne Park looking to make it three wins out of the first three games.
Captain Robbie Skeates is yet to win the toss this season and was put out to field. Harry Trebert 9o 18r 2w and John Foster 9o 33r 2w got the ball rolling picking up quick early wickets bowling very well. Chances went against H Trebert with unfortunate luck against a strong partnership built up by the home team which tested Wherwell&rsquo;s patience in the sun - Tichborne&rsquo;s opener A Joyce scored 81 and N Connel 69.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell played at home against promotion rivals Ramsdell in a crucial match that would decide either teams’ chances of going up this season. S Taylor lost his 11th toss for the season and was put out to bat on a mildy damp wicket.
Ramsdell had an impressive bowling attack with a double wicket maiden in the 6th over having Wherwell on the back foot. R Skeates showed patience early on but wickets tumbled through Wherwell’s usually dominant batting order leaving R Chetwynd-Talbot top scorer with 11.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell played at St Cross on a gloomy day and skipper S Taylor lost the toss again and was put out to bat on a mildly damp wicket.
Incredible performances by the top order kept Wherwell flying high gunning for promotion. R Skeates and G Elwes gave Wherwell the steady start they needed, but after 15o R Skeates had enough and started pummelling. Whippersnapper Elwes enabled the top order and handed the baton to S Taylor who quickly picked up 104 peaking the run rate above 10 at one point before being bowled but leaving his side in a strong position of 237 for 2 off 27.

      <br>
      Stuart Taylor lost another toss and were put into bat on a two-paced wicket. The Wherwell batsmen definitely got their cardio workout due to the slow outfield. All the batsmen got starts however no one was able to fully capitalise on their start. Robbie Skeates top scored with 32 runs, Nathan Young scored 24 runs and Harry Trebert scored 23 runs. R Simpson took 4 wickets for Medstead to keep Wherwell&rsquo;s innings in check.

      <br>
      Wherwell played at home against Alton III&rsquo;s and skipper S Taylor lost the toss and was told to bat.
Wherwell&rsquo;s batting gave Alton a strong reply to their choice to bowl first. R Skeates (17, lbw), S Taylor (60, ct), R Chetwynd-Talbot (20, runout), O Emslie (31, bowled) and J Trebertt (17, not out). Alton III&rsquo;s gave 29 extras to Wherwell giving the home team a reasonable 201 to defend. M Guilfoyle was the only batsmen to not score runs.

      <br>
      Sparsholt won the toss and elected to bat. Missing many of the regular players, Wherwell&rsquo;s makeshift attack restricted Sparsholt to 166-5 in 45 overs on a belter of a wicket. Stuart Taylor and Alex Gladwyn took 2 wickets each and Nathan Young took the other. The highlight of the innings was 61 runs scored by A Gough. Wherwell fielding deserve a special mention, for their hard work in the sweltering heat.

      Wherwell and Liphook &amp; Ripsley II played at Wherwell for an incredibly close game of cricket.
