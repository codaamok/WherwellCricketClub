      <br>
      On the warm summers day, Oakley CC won the toss and decided to bat first. G Dique and D Somner opened for Oakley, and started fluently amidst some decent bowling by O Emslie and H Trebert. S Taylor got the first wicket with a D Somner playing onto his stumps for 18. H Trebert soon got the second bowling M Wood for a duck leaving Oakley 49 for 2 off 10 overs.

      <br>
      On an uneven wicket, Wherwell won the toss and put Longparish into bat. Wherwell started off well with the opening bowler’s S Taylor and O Emslie bowling disciplined line and length, only costing 26 runs in the first 10 overs. Wherwell got the first breakthrough in the 19th over when N Young bowled A Lister for 29 runs. H Trebert joined in the party with another breakthrough in the 22ndover to remove D Bearpark for 2, leaving Longparish 58 for 2.

      <br>
      On a green wicket Wherwell won the toss and elected to bowl. S Taylor and O Emslie started the proceedings but found no assistance early on, however the first change H Trebert struck early on removing the Rowledge opener with an inswinger. N Young joined in the party and ripped apart the Rowledge batting line up. S Taylor and O Emslie came back on cleaned up the tail ending the Rowledge innings on 111 all-out.

      <br>
      Skipper S Taylor won the toss and elected to bowl first with plans to kick start the season with a strong bowling attack. A relatively green wicket, sunny overcast and some strong winds.
Things were looking steady for both sides averaging just under 4/over by the 9th when Overton&rsquo;s opener was caught behind by N Young&rsquo;s exceptional lack-of-spin offspin delivery. 6 overs later their #3 was caught by O Emslie off H Trebert.

      <br>
      Wherwell made the journey to Promotion chasing Bishops Waltham on a gloriously sunny summers day knowing that the chance of promotion had likely slipped by for another year but still with plenty of positives to play for.
Skipper for the day, Alex Gladwyn, won the toss and elected to bowl first under the clear skies on what looked to be a cracking strip much to the bemusement of his team. However once the opening bowlers got loose it proved an inspired decision both Emslie and Taylor bowled with great control and were backed up in the field with Charlie Ingrem in particular excelling at cover.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell travelled to Oakley for the first time in a few years. After winning the toss Skipper Nathan Young thought it would be a good idea to bowl on a slightly green track. The pitch however offered very little to the bowlers. Skipper Young and Oliver Emslie opened the bowling with no success, a few bowling changes followed though as Wherwell searched for a breakthrough. Oakley openers Dique 92 and Summer 54 put on a magnificent 133 run partnership as they made Wherwell work very hard.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell hosted Colden Common on what was probably the hottest Saturday of the year. Wherwell lost the toss and were asked to bat. Wherwell started with serious intent as Robbie Skeates 52 and Craig Beckingham 40 put on a impressive 80 runs partnership from the first 15 overs, They both fell within a few overs of each other as Alex Gladwyn 58 and Stuart Taylor 93 carried on the impressive scoring as they shared a 100 run partnership.

      <br>
      Wherwell 1st X1&rsquo;s skipper, Craig Beckingham, won the toss and decided to bowl first on a green pitch with overcast conditions.
The first innings ticked along nicely for Wherwell with tremendous pressure on Alton where they were just 25 runs off 10 overs. However, with such consistency from both sides, Oliver Emslie went for 21 off 7 overs for 0 and Craig Beckingham at 25 off 7 overs for 2 wickets.

      <br>
      Wherwell won the toss, pitch was green, weather was English. Skipper decided to bowl first on their own strip.
A rare occasion for Wherwell 1st XI playing with just 10 men occured against AWE Tadley. However the hard work was contributed with great team spirit as always regardless of the situation, where Matt Guilfoyle bowled 24 runs off 10 overs for 3 wickets, Craig Beckingham making it difficult for AWE Tadley with just 15 runs off 7 overs, and finally Ed Marsh with 28 runs off 6 overs for 3 wickets.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored travelled to Hursley with a weakened team but full of energy and knowing they should just enjoy the day regardless of result.
After losing the toss they were asked to bat on a very green strip. After losing a few early wickets, Alex Gladwyn and Matt Guilfoyle tried to rebuild the innings with some smart running. Wherwell started to rebuild until a rush of blood was the downfall of Guilfoyle as he played all around a straight ball.
