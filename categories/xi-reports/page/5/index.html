      <br>
      On a green wicket Wherwell won the toss and elected to bowl. S Taylor and O Emslie started the proceedings but found no assistance early on, however the first change H Trebert struck early on removing the Rowledge opener with an inswinger. N Young joined in the party and ripped apart the Rowledge batting line up. S Taylor and O Emslie came back on cleaned up the tail ending the Rowledge innings on 111 all-out.

      <br>
      Skipper S Taylor won the toss and elected to bowl first with plans to kick start the season with a strong bowling attack. A relatively green wicket, sunny overcast and some strong winds.
Things were looking steady for both sides averaging just under 4/over by the 9th when Overton&rsquo;s opener was caught behind by N Young&rsquo;s exceptional lack-of-spin offspin delivery. 6 overs later their #3 was caught by O Emslie off H Trebert.

      <br>
      Wherwell made the journey to Promotion chasing Bishops Waltham on a gloriously sunny summers day knowing that the chance of promotion had likely slipped by for another year but still with plenty of positives to play for.
Skipper for the day, Alex Gladwyn, won the toss and elected to bowl first under the clear skies on what looked to be a cracking strip much to the bemusement of his team. However once the opening bowlers got loose it proved an inspired decision both Emslie and Taylor bowled with great control and were backed up in the field with Charlie Ingrem in particular excelling at cover.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell travelled to Oakley for the first time in a few years. After winning the toss Skipper Nathan Young thought it would be a good idea to bowl on a slightly green track. The pitch however offered very little to the bowlers. Skipper Young and Oliver Emslie opened the bowling with no success, a few bowling changes followed though as Wherwell searched for a breakthrough. Oakley openers Dique 92 and Summer 54 put on a magnificent 133 run partnership as they made Wherwell work very hard.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell hosted Colden Common on what was probably the hottest Saturday of the year. Wherwell lost the toss and were asked to bat. Wherwell started with serious intent as Robbie Skeates 52 and Craig Beckingham 40 put on a impressive 80 runs partnership from the first 15 overs, They both fell within a few overs of each other as Alex Gladwyn 58 and Stuart Taylor 93 carried on the impressive scoring as they shared a 100 run partnership.

      <br>
      Wherwell 1st X1&rsquo;s skipper, Craig Beckingham, won the toss and decided to bowl first on a green pitch with overcast conditions.
The first innings ticked along nicely for Wherwell with tremendous pressure on Alton where they were just 25 runs off 10 overs. However, with such consistency from both sides, Oliver Emslie went for 21 off 7 overs for 0 and Craig Beckingham at 25 off 7 overs for 2 wickets.

      <br>
      Wherwell won the toss, pitch was green, weather was English. Skipper decided to bowl first on their own strip.
A rare occasion for Wherwell 1st XI playing with just 10 men occured against AWE Tadley. However the hard work was contributed with great team spirit as always regardless of the situation, where Matt Guilfoyle bowled 24 runs off 10 overs for 3 wickets, Craig Beckingham making it difficult for AWE Tadley with just 15 runs off 7 overs, and finally Ed Marsh with 28 runs off 6 overs for 3 wickets.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored travelled to Hursley with a weakened team but full of energy and knowing they should just enjoy the day regardless of result.
After losing the toss they were asked to bat on a very green strip. After losing a few early wickets, Alex Gladwyn and Matt Guilfoyle tried to rebuild the innings with some smart running. Wherwell started to rebuild until a rush of blood was the downfall of Guilfoyle as he played all around a straight ball.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell took on Andover 3rds trying to turn around a recent run of defeats. After winning the toss Wherwell decided to bat knowing the weather was going to play a part. After only 3 over the players rushed of the pitch due to a heavy downpour. Exactly 60 minutes and after some hard work the ground was deemed playable. Wherwell lost 3 quick wickets as the pitch was damp on top and Robin Richards 5-12 from 9 overs exposed the uncovered pitch.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell travelled east towards to Basingstoke for what has become a familiar trip (having played away 3 years running to Hobos). After losing the Wherwell were asked to field on probably the hottest Saturday of the year, as the bowlers rotated in the heat Wherwell struggled with the conditions as a few errors crept in. They did however get a injection of energy at second drinks as they started chipping away at the wickets wit regular success.
