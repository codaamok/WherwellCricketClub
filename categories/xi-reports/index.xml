      <description>We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain, We jumped, never asking why We kissed, I fell under your spell, A love no one could deny Don&amp;rsquo;t you ever say I just walked away, I will always want you I can&amp;rsquo;t live a lie, running for my life, I will always want you
Chasing 185, Hursley were 157-4… Wherwell came in like a wrecking ball Having won the toss Wherwell elected to bat, the pitch looked good and the weather better.</description>

      <description>When you&amp;rsquo;re weary, Feeling small When tears are in your eyes, I&amp;rsquo;ll dry them all I&amp;rsquo;m on your side, Oh, when times get rough And friends just can&amp;rsquo;t be found
Troubled waters at camp Wherwell after yesterday&amp;rsquo;s result, but the bridge is that we’ve been here before. In 2019 we suffered an early defeat at the hands of Chawton and went on to win the league.. history has a habit of repeating itself.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been twenty hours and 638 days since they took league cricket away And nothing compares
Wherwell have been itching to get their inaugural Div 3 campaign underway having been hampered by inclement weather throughout May. With the month almost gone without a ball bowled in anger, the forecasts suggested that league cricket would once again commence.
Wherwell won the toss and having chosen to bat were stunned to be 3-1 after the first over, Cooke (2) failing on debut.</description>

      <description>A lump of coal is turned into a diamond with relentless pressure, and that’s exactly what Wherwell exerted against East Woodhay. Top bowling and tight fielding giving very little opportunity.
However it started with a gift, a loopy full toss loosener from Emslie’s first ball was miscued to midwicket, the apology offered probably didn’t make the batsman feel any better. Emslie struck again finding some seam movement and both openers were gone early before a short rain break came.</description>

      <description>Wherwell win County Division 4 North.
KJM sponsored Wherwell for a the final time this season at home to Ampfield. Skipper Robbie Skeates won his first toss in 7 games and decided to bat first, looking to make 11 wins in a row.
With only a slim chance at the league title Wherwell knew they had to be at their best, get maximum points and hope other results go their way.</description>
