      <description>Wherwell are proud to have secured a new sponsor AMF Engineering. We are also happy to announce another renewal with long-term sponsor KJM.
In light of our new sponsorship deals, we are kitting out all our members with brand new kit ready for the 2020 season!
Over the last few seasons Wherwell have come from strength to strength. Last year&amp;rsquo;s performance secured us a spot in the Division 3 North and we&amp;rsquo;re looking forward to new challenges ahead.</description>

      <description>Wherwell win County Division 4 North.
KJM sponsored Wherwell for a the final time this season at home to Ampfield. Skipper Robbie Skeates won his first toss in 7 games and decided to bat first, looking to make 11 wins in a row.
With only a slim chance at the league title Wherwell knew they had to be at their best, get maximum points and hope other results go their way.</description>
