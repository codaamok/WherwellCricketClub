      <br>
      KJM sponsored made the short journey to London Road 2 pitch, to find a wicket that looked dull and lifeless, After winning the toss Wherwell inserted their hosts and with no real back bone to their innings Andover soon collapsed away as Wherwell took wickets at regular intervals bowled out there hosts for just 117, with the pick of bowlers Mark Pettman 3-25, Stuart Taylor 2-15 and Matt Guilfoyle 2-20.

      <br>
      With summer finally making a show KJM sponsored Wherwell 1st XI travelled to play Compton &amp; Chandlers Ford, the ground looking perfect set as it is amongst a private development and benefitting from significant recent investments in it&rsquo;s infrastructure that provided excellent protection from the previous days rain. With Captain &ldquo;Trucker&rdquo; Taylor winning the toss he typically elected to bat first.
Unfortunately the plan didn&rsquo;t pan out as hoped with both Wherwell openers falling in single figures.

      <br>
      KJM Sponsored Wherwell made the trip to Hobos just outside of Basingstoke, in an unlikely turn of events captain Stuart Taylor won the toss and for a change Wherwell chose to bowl first on a very average looking strip. This decision soon proved to be vindicated with the Wherwell bowlers taking regular wickets. The visiting side bowled Hobos out inside 21 overs for just 57. Nathan Young 3 for 4, Christian Nicel 3 for 12, Matt Guilfoyle 3 for 14 and Stuart Taylor 1-15 picking up all the wickets.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell 1st XI travelled to Midhurst in West Sussex. Wherwell won the toss and bowled first. Midhurst scored 139 all out on a damp surface, S Lush top scoring with 66. Stuart Taylor 3-30 Matt Guilfoyle 3-21 Nathan Young 2 -22 Christian Nicel 1-14 were the wicket takers. In reply Stuart Taylor 11 Nathan Young 30 opened the batting getting Wherwell off to a good start with contributions from Elton Adamo 21 Alex Gladwyn 35no Dave Langford 15 and Matt Guilfoyle 11no saw Wherwell comfortably home to the total and ending up on 140-4.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell always knew this trip would be a tough one and so it proved under the blazing sun they were asked to bat first on what looked a good track. Taylor and John started well but both fell as the pitch showed some variable pace and bounce. Once again indiscipline showed as the middle order got them selves out with a combination of poor shot choice and bad luck.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell travelled to sparsholt wondering how much of a game would get played as the grey clouds threatened to halt play again. Losing the toss they were asked to bat on a very hard green wicket. Starting with intent Jez Wickman and Ed John built a steady opening partnership scoring all round the wicket. Ed John (13) started to look in form before squaring himself up in front of all 3 stumps for a easy LBW decision.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell travelled into Wiltshire to play against Steeple Langford. Both skippers knowing the toss was crucial. Wherwell lost it and were made to bowl. Christian Nicel got a early breakthrough but it was always going to tough fielding first in the heat on a lovely batting track. Steeple Langford built a total as they started shifting through the gears going from 90-2 from 27 overs to 270-6 from 45.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell hosted AWE Tadley on a damp strip. Losing the toss Wherwell were asked to bat. Stuart Taylor was dropped in the third over and this proved costly as he went on to punish the visitors scoring 76, unfortunately only Elton Adamo offered real support with a well crafted 32 as the home side labored to 167 all out. In reply Craig Beckingham was given the opportunity to open the bowling and his tight lines forced a early run out.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell hosted Crown Taverners in a mid table clash. Wherwell won the toss and elected to bowl on a flat batting strip knowing using the new ball would be key and so it proved. Stuart Taylor 3-32 and Christian Nicel 2-20 opened the bowling and bowled tight lines creating chances by keeping the run rate down. Both picked up wickets in first few overs as the pace proved too much.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwells good start to the season came to a grinding halt against Dinton as the batsman went missing in the sun. Wherwell posted a well below par 110 all out from 33 overs. Knowing it would be very difficult to defend Wherwell had to attack from the off. A wicket in the 3rd over got Wherwells hopes up but that was to be it till Dinton had all but won the won game.
