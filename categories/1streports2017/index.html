      KJM sponsored Wherwell played at home against promotion rivals Ramsdell in a crucial match that would decide either teams’ chances of going up this season. S Taylor lost his 11th toss for the season and was put out to bat on a mildy damp wicket.
Ramsdell had an impressive bowling attack with a double wicket maiden in the 6th over having Wherwell on the back foot. R Skeates showed patience early on but wickets tumbled through Wherwell’s usually dominant batting order leaving R Chetwynd-Talbot top scorer with 11.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell played at St Cross on a gloomy day and skipper S Taylor lost the toss again and was put out to bat on a mildly damp wicket.
Incredible performances by the top order kept Wherwell flying high gunning for promotion. R Skeates and G Elwes gave Wherwell the steady start they needed, but after 15o R Skeates had enough and started pummelling. Whippersnapper Elwes enabled the top order and handed the baton to S Taylor who quickly picked up 104 peaking the run rate above 10 at one point before being bowled but leaving his side in a strong position of 237 for 2 off 27.

      <br>

R Simpson took 4 wickets for Medstead to keep Wherwell&rsquo;s innings in check.

      <br>

      <br>
