      <description>A lump of coal is turned into a diamond with relentless pressure, and that’s exactly what Wherwell exerted against East Woodhay. Top bowling and tight fielding giving very little opportunity.
However it started with a gift, a loopy full toss loosener from Emslie’s first ball was miscued to midwicket, the apology offered probably didn’t make the batsman feel any better. Emslie struck again finding some seam movement and both openers were gone early before a short rain break came.</description>
