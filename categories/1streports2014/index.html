      <br>
      Wherwell 1st X1&rsquo;s skipper, Craig Beckingham, won the toss and decided to bowl first on a green pitch with overcast conditions.
The first innings ticked along nicely for Wherwell with tremendous pressure on Alton where they were just 25 runs off 10 overs. However, with such consistency from both sides, Oliver Emslie went for 21 off 7 overs for 0 and Craig Beckingham at 25 off 7 overs for 2 wickets.

      <br>
      Wherwell won the toss, pitch was green, weather was English. Skipper decided to bowl first on their own strip.
A rare occasion for Wherwell 1st XI playing with just 10 men occured against AWE Tadley. However the hard work was contributed with great team spirit as always regardless of the situation, where Matt Guilfoyle bowled 24 runs off 10 overs for 3 wickets, Craig Beckingham making it difficult for AWE Tadley with just 15 runs off 7 overs, and finally Ed Marsh with 28 runs off 6 overs for 3 wickets.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored travelled to Hursley with a weakened team but full of energy and knowing they should just enjoy the day regardless of result.
After losing the toss they were asked to bat on a very green strip. After losing a few early wickets, Alex Gladwyn and Matt Guilfoyle tried to rebuild the innings with some smart running. Wherwell started to rebuild until a rush of blood was the downfall of Guilfoyle as he played all around a straight ball.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell took on Andover 3rds trying to turn around a recent run of defeats. After winning the toss Wherwell decided to bat knowing the weather was going to play a part. After only 3 over the players rushed of the pitch due to a heavy downpour. Exactly 60 minutes and after some hard work the ground was deemed playable. Wherwell lost 3 quick wickets as the pitch was damp on top and Robin Richards 5-12 from 9 overs exposed the uncovered pitch.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell travelled east towards to Basingstoke for what has become a familiar trip (having played away 3 years running to Hobos). After losing the Wherwell were asked to field on probably the hottest Saturday of the year, as the bowlers rotated in the heat Wherwell struggled with the conditions as a few errors crept in. They did however get a injection of energy at second drinks as they started chipping away at the wickets wit regular success.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell travelled to Compton looking to make it back to back wins in this fragmented season. Overnight rain had caught out the home side and the covers had not been used meaning there was a drying surface making the idea of bowling first highly inviting. Nathan Young called correct and had no hesitation inviting the home side to bat.
Stuart Taylor and Craig Beckingham took the new ball and immediately batting looked difficult with inconsistent bounce and pace troubling the batters, it was Taylor who made the breakthrough having the open adjudged caught behind with the score struggling to stay ahead of the overs, a brief flurry from the home side number 4 pushed the scoring rate to nearly 3 an over and the home side looked set for a reasonable score with wickets in hand but Wherwells change bowlers were all on song and the home side stalled and stuttered from 51 for 2 to 106 all out.

      <br>
      Wherwell 1st XI travelled North to Donnington, a lovely setting though heavily affected by the bad weather the pitch whilst flat was clearly going to present a challenge for batters. Therefore when the toss was won by the home side there was no surprise when they asked Wherwell to bat.
Craig Beckingham and Jeremy Wickham made a slow but solid start under testing conditions, the outfield being slow meant boundaries were hard to find, Beckingham was first to depart for a gritty 17, this brought Stuart Taylor to the crease, it didn&rsquo;t take him long to settle and once in to his stride the slowness of the outfield was bypassed as the first match ball was lost, down a rabbit hole most likely, in a nearby field.

      <br>
      If you don&rsquo;t like what you see here get the Trucks out!
KJM sponsored Wherwell hosted Amesbury on what can only be described a scorchingly hot day. The wicket for the first time this season was dry, and after winning the toss the visiting skipper Dale Gower had no hesitation in bowling first. Wherwell started slowly trying to build a score. Beckingham (9) and Wickham (16) stayed put seen off the original scare in the first 5 overs.

      <br>
      With thunder-storms on the horizon KJM sponsored Wherwell did all they could to get a game on with players attending the ground before most had breakfast. Winterslow won the toss and decided to bowl on the previously covered pitch, this proved to be a crucial win of the toss as the ball nipped everywhere. Beckingham 29 and Taylor 41 the only batsman to show any true fight and dig in. Wherwells batsman have often been their own downfall and today was no different.
