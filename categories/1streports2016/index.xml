      <description>Renewed partnership KJM sponsored Wherwell hosted Holybourne I. Cpt Robbie Skeates lost the toss and Wherwell were to bowl.
After a good start from Holybourne&amp;rsquo;s openers, the breakthrough was made by Mark Pettman. Holybourne raced on to 65-2 looking to score high but tremendous field work and bowling restricted them to 148 all out. Stuart Taylor bowled 29 for 1 off 10 and backed up by Ollie Emslie 29 for 2 off 10.</description>
