      <description>A lump of coal is turned into a diamond with relentless pressure, and that’s exactly what Wherwell exerted against East Woodhay. Top bowling and tight fielding giving very little opportunity.
However it started with a gift, a loopy full toss loosener from Emslie’s first ball was miscued to midwicket, the apology offered probably didn’t make the batsman feel any better. Emslie struck again finding some seam movement and both openers were gone early before a short rain break came.</description>

      <description>Wherwell win County Division 4 North.
KJM sponsored Wherwell for a the final time this season at home to Ampfield. Skipper Robbie Skeates won his first toss in 7 games and decided to bat first, looking to make 11 wins in a row.
With only a slim chance at the league title Wherwell knew they had to be at their best, get maximum points and hope other results go their way.</description>
