      <br>
      A depleted 2nds team took on Centurions. With only a few bowlers available the task was always going to be tough. Brendan Tasker 43-2, Rob Weeks 47-2 and Charles Ingram 3runs -4 wickets were the pick of the bowlers as they bowled them out for 163. In reply Wherwell started well with Mick Ling (28) and Nigel Horne 68 not out, (first ever league 50) providing a foundation for which Wherwell hoped to kick on but unfortunately it wasn&rsquo;t to be as they fell 8runs short of the target.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell hosted Crown Taverners in a mid table clash. Wherwell won the toss and elected to bowl on a flat batting strip knowing using the new ball would be key and so it proved. Stuart Taylor 3-32 and Christian Nicel 2-20 opened the bowling and bowled tight lines creating chances by keeping the run rate down. Both picked up wickets in first few overs as the pace proved too much.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwells good start to the season came to a grinding halt against Dinton as the batsman went missing in the sun. Wherwell posted a well below par 110 all out from 33 overs. Knowing it would be very difficult to defend Wherwell had to attack from the off. A wicket in the 3rd over got Wherwells hopes up but that was to be it till Dinton had all but won the won game.

      <br>
      Kjm sponosred wherwell got there season off to a flyer by producing a great team display. Losing the toss Wherwell were ask to bat on a very green strip. Staurt &ldquo;Trucker&quot;Taylor (11) and new opening partner Ed John (10)set the tone as the dug deep and kept the new ball out for 10 overs. Ed John miss-timed a ball and that popped up to mid on. This brought a mini collapse as Taylor and Beckingham soon followed.

      <br>
      On the rare occasion this season of a sunny Saturday KJM sponsored Wherwell entertained Farley at a dry but soft playing Fields ground. Having lost the toss Wherwell were asked to bowl, with a young side Dan Pawley and Harry Trebert were entrusted the new ball and both bowled with good control but it was the introduction of Mick Ling that brought the first wicket with a well taken catch by Rory Griffin at fine leg, Griffin bowled unchanged through 10 overs and was unrewarded despite bowling a consistent line and finishing with only 27 runs from his 10.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell 2nd XI, playing in there fourth home game in a row, lost the toss to Hungerford and were put into field with the sun beating down on the Playing Fields ground. Ollie Emslie and Harry Trebert opened the bowling and started with tight lines and good lengths, and both took a couple of wickets each in the opening spells of five overs. Hungerford were losing wickets at regular intervals with no one scoring above 20.

      <br>
      KJM Sponsored Wherwell entertained Langley Manor and after winning the toss, captain Mick Ling decided to bat on another very hot summer day. Opening pairing of Mick Ling and Nigel Horne made a comfortable start putting on 40 before Horne was caught for 16, then after losing Harry Trebert for a first ball duck. This brought Steve Bonsor to crease and he began to hit boundaries to all part of the ground before he was run out for a very well constructed 43, Mark Pembry 26 able supported him in the 60 run partnership and after losing them, the lower order helped Wherwell up to a total of 178-7 off there 42 overs.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell hosted M &amp; T 3rd XI off the back of their first league win. With a number of players unavailable the team had a decidedly &ldquo;senior&rdquo; look to it but sometimes old heads are high value and that was proven in amongst the showers under the grey sky. Losing the toss Wherwell were asked to bat and lost the skipper to a 2 man catch early on, Nigel Horne though is starting to look settled and played some gorgeous shots to all corners, a 3rd Wicket 50 run partnership with Mark Pembry (18) looked like being the bedrock of a good total until Pembry left his crease to the spinner, the keeper failed to take the ball but it rebounded off his pads and had the unfortunate batter adjudged stumped.

      <br>
      1st XI sign off with Thunder and Lightening.
Aptly for this summer Wherwell were forced to play a home game on a neighbours ground under leaden skies with rain forecast. Whilst many games were called off Wherwell debated how to get the mower going so that the pitch would be more suitable for cricket rather than a picnic, unfortunately whilst they pondered this the unthinkable happened, Captain Dave Langford won the toss!

      <br>
      Wherwell suffered a 10 wicket home defeat at the hands of a strong Sparsholt side. Having lost the toss the home side were skittled for 115 with only Charlie Ingrem and Cray Sams showing resistance. The bowlers too were up against it and found the visitors opening pair impregnable as they cruised to the target of 116 with several overs to spare
