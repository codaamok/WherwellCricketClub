      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell 2nd XI, playing in there fourth home game in a row, lost the toss to Hungerford and were put into field with the sun beating down on the Playing Fields ground. Ollie Emslie and Harry Trebert opened the bowling and started with tight lines and good lengths, and both took a couple of wickets each in the opening spells of five overs. Hungerford were losing wickets at regular intervals with no one scoring above 20.

      <br>
      KJM Sponsored Wherwell entertained Langley Manor and after winning the toss, captain Mick Ling decided to bat on another very hot summer day. Opening pairing of Mick Ling and Nigel Horne made a comfortable start putting on 40 before Horne was caught for 16, then after losing Harry Trebert for a first ball duck. This brought Steve Bonsor to crease and he began to hit boundaries to all part of the ground before he was run out for a very well constructed 43, Mark Pembry 26 able supported him in the 60 run partnership and after losing them, the lower order helped Wherwell up to a total of 178-7 off there 42 overs.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell hosted M &amp; T 3rd XI off the back of their first league win. With a number of players unavailable the team had a decidedly &ldquo;senior&rdquo; look to it but sometimes old heads are high value and that was proven in amongst the showers under the grey sky. Losing the toss Wherwell were asked to bat and lost the skipper to a 2 man catch early on, Nigel Horne though is starting to look settled and played some gorgeous shots to all corners, a 3rd Wicket 50 run partnership with Mark Pembry (18) looked like being the bedrock of a good total until Pembry left his crease to the spinner, the keeper failed to take the ball but it rebounded off his pads and had the unfortunate batter adjudged stumped.

      <br>
      1st XI sign off with Thunder and Lightening.
Aptly for this summer Wherwell were forced to play a home game on a neighbours ground under leaden skies with rain forecast. Whilst many games were called off Wherwell debated how to get the mower going so that the pitch would be more suitable for cricket rather than a picnic, unfortunately whilst they pondered this the unthinkable happened, Captain Dave Langford won the toss!

      <br>
      Wherwell suffered a 10 wicket home defeat at the hands of a strong Sparsholt side. Having lost the toss the home side were skittled for 115 with only Charlie Ingrem and Cray Sams showing resistance. The bowlers too were up against it and found the visitors opening pair impregnable as they cruised to the target of 116 with several overs to spare

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell entertained unbeaten and top of the league Steep. Losing the toos Wherwell were put into field and it was always going to be a batsmen&rsquo;s day. The innings was built on Knight 79 and Noble 89 who forming a huge partnership.They both excellently rotated the strike in the hot summers afternoon wearing down the Wherwell bowlers. When Noble ran out of steam and skied one to the keeper.

      <br>
      Whewell hosted Whitchurch under clear blue skies with the ground looking splendid. With the visitors winning the toss wherwell were asked to bat on what appeared to be a good strip. The opening pair of Nigel Horne and Mick Ling started well and had made reasonable progress before horne was well caught behind from an inside edge, this heralded the introduction of Oliver Emslie who settled quickly and batted well with Ling.

      <br>
      With thunder-storms on the horizon KJM sponsored Wherwell did all they could to get a game on with players attending the ground before most had breakfast. Winterslow won the toss and decided to bowl on the previously covered pitch, this proved to be a crucial win of the toss as the ball nipped everywhere. Beckingham 29 and Taylor 41 the only batsman to show any true fight and dig in. Wherwells batsman have often been their own downfall and today was no different.

      <br>
      Following the wet 2012 season it was no surprise that the 2013 season started with rain in the air and a soft pitch. With a strong wind blowing straight up the ground Wherwell fielded first and initial exchanges were favoring the home side, Charlie Ingram and Harry Trebert bowled good lines and kept the batsmen honest but without success as the chances offered early were not taken. The first 12 overs went slowly supported by rain and wind but the change of bowling added momentum to the batting side, Mick Ling introduced himself to bowl into the teeth of a strong blow and immediately found the line difficult to control, after a watchful first over consisting of 10 balls the Winterslow opening batsman cut loose hitting hard to the on-side and within 4 overs had gone from 20 to 50 despite loosing his young opening partner.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell travelled the short distance over to Whitchurch in a must win game to keep survival hopes alive. Both teams hampered with injuries and holidays did well to field to 11 players. Wherwell lost the toss and were asked to bat, Wherwell got lucky in the first over when Taylor was dropped from his first ball, something Whitchurch would go on to regret. Leamon fell early at the other end to a well taken catch.
