      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell travelled to Oakley for the first time in a few years. After winning the toss Skipper Nathan Young thought it would be a good idea to bowl on a slightly green track. The pitch however offered very little to the bowlers. Skipper Young and Oliver Emslie opened the bowling with no success, a few bowling changes followed though as Wherwell searched for a breakthrough. Oakley openers Dique 92 and Summer 54 put on a magnificent 133 run partnership as they made Wherwell work very hard.

Wherwell 2nds traveled to Ashford Hill aiming to bounce back from a 6 run defeat last weekend. New captain for the day, Harry Trebert, won the toss and chose to bowl first. Wherwell got off to an impressive start with Nick Baughen by picking up the first wicket of the day for Wherwell, closely followed by Scott Blackmore who bowled a very good spell by getting 2 for 51 off his 10 overs.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell hosted Colden Common on what was probably the hottest Saturday of the year. Wherwell lost the toss and were asked to bat. Wherwell started with serious intent as Robbie Skeates 52 and Craig Beckingham 40 put on a impressive 80 runs partnership from the first 15 overs, They both fell within a few overs of each other as Alex Gladwyn 58 and Stuart Taylor 93 carried on the impressive scoring as they shared a 100 run partnership.

      <br>
      After three years away, KJM sponsored Wherwell CC re-entered the Winchester Indoor Cricket League this winter. Having to re-enter into Division Four, when they last played in 2012 were in Division Two. This year however was a very different team to the side in 2012, The average age of this years team was 22. Wherwell came through the whole season unbeaten winning 9 out 9 with contributions from the whole team throughout the season.

      <br>
      Wherwell 1st X1&rsquo;s skipper, Craig Beckingham, won the toss and decided to bowl first on a green pitch with overcast conditions.
The first innings ticked along nicely for Wherwell with tremendous pressure on Alton where they were just 25 runs off 10 overs. However, with such consistency from both sides, Oliver Emslie went for 21 off 7 overs for 0 and Craig Beckingham at 25 off 7 overs for 2 wickets.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell Second Xl cruised to a club record win against Alderholt Second X1.
Despite the summer holidays reducing Wherwell to 9 players, the club amassed 307 for 5 wickets during their allotted 42 overs - a club record. Star of the show was undoubtedly Charlie Ingrem. Smashing the ball to all parts of Alderholt’s lovely ground he raced past fifty before a muscle injury forced him to retire. Steve Bonser also notched a fifty before re-arranging his wicket by means of falling over it.

      <br>
      Wherwell travelled to Crawley in an entertaining fixture, which was fitting for Crawley in their centenary season. Wherwell won the toss and elected to bat. After the fall of 2 early wickets, opener Ed John and Stuart Taylor made good starts before getting out, short of their half centuries. Wherwell maintained a healthy run rate, but wickets continued to fall. With 180 looking a par score, Wherwell struggled on 141-6. However, that brought the partnership of Charles Ingreme and Luke Trebert.

      <br>
      Wherwell won the toss, pitch was green, weather was English. Skipper decided to bowl first on their own strip.
A rare occasion for Wherwell 1st XI playing with just 10 men occured against AWE Tadley. However the hard work was contributed with great team spirit as always regardless of the situation, where Matt Guilfoyle bowled 24 runs off 10 overs for 3 wickets, Craig Beckingham making it difficult for AWE Tadley with just 15 runs off 7 overs, and finally Ed Marsh with 28 runs off 6 overs for 3 wickets.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored travelled to Hursley with a weakened team but full of energy and knowing they should just enjoy the day regardless of result.
After losing the toss they were asked to bat on a very green strip. After losing a few early wickets, Alex Gladwyn and Matt Guilfoyle tried to rebuild the innings with some smart running. Wherwell started to rebuild until a rush of blood was the downfall of Guilfoyle as he played all around a straight ball.

      <br>
      After an unpredictable evening before the game of weather and some hard work from several Wherwell players, the pitch was deemed playable and the call was made to Sway to travel up.
Wherwell&rsquo;s Sunday skipper won the toss and chose to bat on a damp looking pitch. Openers Stuart Taylor and Jordan Trebert opened the batting and were greeted with some very generous bowling, of which Taylor made the most of it, by reaching his 50 just after 3 overs.
