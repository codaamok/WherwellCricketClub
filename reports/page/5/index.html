      <br>
      On a green wicket Wherwell won the toss and elected to bowl. S Taylor and O Emslie started the proceedings but found no assistance early on, however the first change H Trebert struck early on removing the Rowledge opener with an inswinger. N Young joined in the party and ripped apart the Rowledge batting line up. S Taylor and O Emslie came back on cleaned up the tail ending the Rowledge innings on 111 all-out.

      <br>
      Skipper S Taylor won the toss and elected to bowl first with plans to kick start the season with a strong bowling attack. A relatively green wicket, sunny overcast and some strong winds.
Things were looking steady for both sides averaging just under 4/over by the 9th when Overton&rsquo;s opener was caught behind by N Young&rsquo;s exceptional lack-of-spin offspin delivery. 6 overs later their #3 was caught by O Emslie off H Trebert.

      <br>
      Renewed partnership KJM sponsored Wherwell hosted Holybourne I. Cpt Robbie Skeates lost the toss and Wherwell were to bowl.
After a good start from Holybourne&rsquo;s openers, the breakthrough was made by Mark Pettman. Holybourne raced on to 65-2 looking to score high but tremendous field work and bowling restricted them to 148 all out. Stuart Taylor bowled 29 for 1 off 10 and backed up by Ollie Emslie 29 for 2 off 10.

      <br>
      Wherwell II’s skip Cray Sams won the toss and skipped C Sams decided to bowl.
Rob Gladwyn opened the bowling with a wicket maiden giving Wherwell II a good start. The pitch was a difficult one for Winterslow II’s openers to gain momentum as Wherwell kept the fielding tight and with tactical rollers and bouncers, but the bowling extras relieved some of the pressure. New comer Rob White came onto bowl breaking the developing partnership of Winterslow II’s and created a good opportunity to regain the match at 98 for 2 off 20.

      <br>
      Wherwell made the journey to Promotion chasing Bishops Waltham on a gloriously sunny summers day knowing that the chance of promotion had likely slipped by for another year but still with plenty of positives to play for.
Skipper for the day, Alex Gladwyn, won the toss and elected to bowl first under the clear skies on what looked to be a cracking strip much to the bemusement of his team. However once the opening bowlers got loose it proved an inspired decision both Emslie and Taylor bowled with great control and were backed up in the field with Charlie Ingrem in particular excelling at cover.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell travelled to Oakley for the first time in a few years. After winning the toss Skipper Nathan Young thought it would be a good idea to bowl on a slightly green track. The pitch however offered very little to the bowlers. Skipper Young and Oliver Emslie opened the bowling with no success, a few bowling changes followed though as Wherwell searched for a breakthrough. Oakley openers Dique 92 and Summer 54 put on a magnificent 133 run partnership as they made Wherwell work very hard.

Wherwell 2nds traveled to Ashford Hill aiming to bounce back from a 6 run defeat last weekend. New captain for the day, Harry Trebert, won the toss and chose to bowl first. Wherwell got off to an impressive start with Nick Baughen by picking up the first wicket of the day for Wherwell, closely followed by Scott Blackmore who bowled a very good spell by getting 2 for 51 off his 10 overs.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell hosted Colden Common on what was probably the hottest Saturday of the year. Wherwell lost the toss and were asked to bat. Wherwell started with serious intent as Robbie Skeates 52 and Craig Beckingham 40 put on a impressive 80 runs partnership from the first 15 overs, They both fell within a few overs of each other as Alex Gladwyn 58 and Stuart Taylor 93 carried on the impressive scoring as they shared a 100 run partnership.

      <br>
      Wherwell 1st X1&rsquo;s skipper, Craig Beckingham, won the toss and decided to bowl first on a green pitch with overcast conditions.
The first innings ticked along nicely for Wherwell with tremendous pressure on Alton where they were just 25 runs off 10 overs. However, with such consistency from both sides, Oliver Emslie went for 21 off 7 overs for 0 and Craig Beckingham at 25 off 7 overs for 2 wickets.
