      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell entertained unbeaten and top of the league Steep. Losing the toos Wherwell were put into field and it was always going to be a batsmen&rsquo;s day. The innings was built on Knight 79 and Noble 89 who forming a huge partnership.They both excellently rotated the strike in the hot summers afternoon wearing down the Wherwell bowlers. When Noble ran out of steam and skied one to the keeper.

      <br>
      Whewell hosted Whitchurch under clear blue skies with the ground looking splendid. With the visitors winning the toss wherwell were asked to bat on what appeared to be a good strip. The opening pair of Nigel Horne and Mick Ling started well and had made reasonable progress before horne was well caught behind from an inside edge, this heralded the introduction of Oliver Emslie who settled quickly and batted well with Ling.

      <br>
      With thunder-storms on the horizon KJM sponsored Wherwell did all they could to get a game on with players attending the ground before most had breakfast. Winterslow won the toss and decided to bowl on the previously covered pitch, this proved to be a crucial win of the toss as the ball nipped everywhere. Beckingham 29 and Taylor 41 the only batsman to show any true fight and dig in. Wherwells batsman have often been their own downfall and today was no different.

      <br>
      Following the wet 2012 season it was no surprise that the 2013 season started with rain in the air and a soft pitch. With a strong wind blowing straight up the ground Wherwell fielded first and initial exchanges were favoring the home side, Charlie Ingram and Harry Trebert bowled good lines and kept the batsmen honest but without success as the chances offered early were not taken. The first 12 overs went slowly supported by rain and wind but the change of bowling added momentum to the batting side, Mick Ling introduced himself to bowl into the teeth of a strong blow and immediately found the line difficult to control, after a watchful first over consisting of 10 balls the Winterslow opening batsman cut loose hitting hard to the on-side and within 4 overs had gone from 20 to 50 despite loosing his young opening partner.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell travelled the short distance over to Whitchurch in a must win game to keep survival hopes alive. Both teams hampered with injuries and holidays did well to field to 11 players. Wherwell lost the toss and were asked to bat, Wherwell got lucky in the first over when Taylor was dropped from his first ball, something Whitchurch would go on to regret. Leamon fell early at the other end to a well taken catch.

      <br>
      With most league cricket finished for the season it was a pleasing mix of youth and experience that formed the KJM sponsored Wherwell team that visited Winterbourne. The home side had already won the division and with their 1st XI also confirmed champions of their division both sides had some big guns on display.
Wherwell lost the toss and was invited to bowl, with Harry Trebert (2 for 38) taking the new ball in partnership with Christian Nicel (1 for 21 from 8)youth and experience were head to head and to his credit youth struck first with Trebert getting the breakthrough thanks to a sharp Stuart Taylor catch, Nicel was once again the victim of dropped catches seeing 3 go down and finally resulted to full and straight to get his rewards.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell 2 XI visited Winterslow on an blustery saturday with a reduced side due to holidays and a extremem mixture of Youth and Senior players. Having lost the toss Wherwell were asked to field as the home side looked to cash in on the inexperience and shortage of numbers, however they didn&rsquo;t account for the 13 year old Brendon Tasker playing his first ever senior game. He was asked to take the first over and picked up a wicket almost instantly thanks to the safe hands of Mick Ling.
