      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell Second Xl cruised to a club record win against Alderholt Second X1.
Despite the summer holidays reducing Wherwell to 9 players, the club amassed 307 for 5 wickets during their allotted 42 overs - a club record. Star of the show was undoubtedly Charlie Ingrem. Smashing the ball to all parts of Alderholt’s lovely ground he raced past fifty before a muscle injury forced him to retire. Steve Bonser also notched a fifty before re-arranging his wicket by means of falling over it.

      <br>
      Wherwell travelled to Crawley in an entertaining fixture, which was fitting for Crawley in their centenary season. Wherwell won the toss and elected to bat. After the fall of 2 early wickets, opener Ed John and Stuart Taylor made good starts before getting out, short of their half centuries. Wherwell maintained a healthy run rate, but wickets continued to fall. With 180 looking a par score, Wherwell struggled on 141-6. However, that brought the partnership of Charles Ingreme and Luke Trebert.

      <br>
      Wherwell won the toss, pitch was green, weather was English. Skipper decided to bowl first on their own strip.
A rare occasion for Wherwell 1st XI playing with just 10 men occured against AWE Tadley. However the hard work was contributed with great team spirit as always regardless of the situation, where Matt Guilfoyle bowled 24 runs off 10 overs for 3 wickets, Craig Beckingham making it difficult for AWE Tadley with just 15 runs off 7 overs, and finally Ed Marsh with 28 runs off 6 overs for 3 wickets.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored travelled to Hursley with a weakened team but full of energy and knowing they should just enjoy the day regardless of result.
After losing the toss they were asked to bat on a very green strip. After losing a few early wickets, Alex Gladwyn and Matt Guilfoyle tried to rebuild the innings with some smart running. Wherwell started to rebuild until a rush of blood was the downfall of Guilfoyle as he played all around a straight ball.

      <br>
      After an unpredictable evening before the game of weather and some hard work from several Wherwell players, the pitch was deemed playable and the call was made to Sway to travel up.
Wherwell&rsquo;s Sunday skipper won the toss and chose to bat on a damp looking pitch. Openers Stuart Taylor and Jordan Trebert opened the batting and were greeted with some very generous bowling, of which Taylor made the most of it, by reaching his 50 just after 3 overs.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell took on Andover 3rds trying to turn around a recent run of defeats. After winning the toss Wherwell decided to bat knowing the weather was going to play a part. After only 3 over the players rushed of the pitch due to a heavy downpour. Exactly 60 minutes and after some hard work the ground was deemed playable. Wherwell lost 3 quick wickets as the pitch was damp on top and Robin Richards 5-12 from 9 overs exposed the uncovered pitch.
