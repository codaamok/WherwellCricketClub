      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell took on Andover 3rds trying to turn around a recent run of defeats. After winning the toss Wherwell decided to bat knowing the weather was going to play a part. After only 3 over the players rushed of the pitch due to a heavy downpour. Exactly 60 minutes and after some hard work the ground was deemed playable. Wherwell lost 3 quick wickets as the pitch was damp on top and Robin Richards 5-12 from 9 overs exposed the uncovered pitch.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell travelled east towards to Basingstoke for what has become a familiar trip (having played away 3 years running to Hobos). After losing the Wherwell were asked to field on probably the hottest Saturday of the year, as the bowlers rotated in the heat Wherwell struggled with the conditions as a few errors crept in. They did however get a injection of energy at second drinks as they started chipping away at the wickets wit regular success.

      <br>
      Compton &amp; C Ford travelled to Wherwell on one of warmest days of the year, to having one won the toss and elected to bowl first. Experienced skipper Mick Ling with up-and-coming youthful member Nick Baughen opened the batting, however young Baughen was quickly caught out. Wherwell not long after lost another wicket and were looking in trouble within the first ten overs, but new player Giles Elwes soon walked up to the crease and hit the highest score of the day, 65.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored wherwell looked to get back to winning ways in there Sunday friendly against Southampton warriors. Captain Alex Gladwyn won the toss and decided to bat first. Wherwell lost early wickets and after 8 overs were 27 for 3, this brought together inform Stuart Taylor and captain Gladwyn, both batsman batted well and put together an 85 run partnership before Gladwyn departed for 36. Taylor held the innings together striking some lusty blows before being bowled for 96 trying to smash his way to his 5th 100 this season but got Wherwell to good total of 224.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored made the short journey to London Road 2 pitch, to find a wicket that looked dull and lifeless, After winning the toss Wherwell inserted their hosts and with no real back bone to their innings Andover soon collapsed away as Wherwell took wickets at regular intervals bowled out there hosts for just 117, with the pick of bowlers Mark Pettman 3-25, Stuart Taylor 2-15 and Matt Guilfoyle 2-20.

      <br>
      Both teams went into the game knowing it was going to be a real close one. KJM sponsored Wherwell in true tradition lost the toss and were asked to bat. Craig Beckingham and Stuart Taylor opened the batting and faced a some good lines and lengths from Robin Richards and Robbie Taylor. A smart catch by Stewart Clackson seen the end of Craig Beckingham, Taylor got a lifeline when bowled from a no-ball, he would go one to punish the bowlers for this mistake.

      <br>
      With the forecast of heavy rain KJM sponsored Wherwell made the journey to Minstead in the New Forest not expecting to get much cricket played against a Cadnam side sitting alongside the visitors in the league. Suprisingly the game got underway on time under leaden skies with Wherwell invited to bat on what looked a traditional strip with plenty of grass and a few hoof prints fortunately well short of a length.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell travelled to Compton looking to make it back to back wins in this fragmented season. Overnight rain had caught out the home side and the covers had not been used meaning there was a drying surface making the idea of bowling first highly inviting. Nathan Young called correct and had no hesitation inviting the home side to bat.
Stuart Taylor and Craig Beckingham took the new ball and immediately batting looked difficult with inconsistent bounce and pace troubling the batters, it was Taylor who made the breakthrough having the open adjudged caught behind with the score struggling to stay ahead of the overs, a brief flurry from the home side number 4 pushed the scoring rate to nearly 3 an over and the home side looked set for a reasonable score with wickets in hand but Wherwells change bowlers were all on song and the home side stalled and stuttered from 51 for 2 to 106 all out.

      <br>
      With summer finally making a show KJM sponsored Wherwell 1st XI travelled to play Compton &amp; Chandlers Ford, the ground looking perfect set as it is amongst a private development and benefitting from significant recent investments in it&rsquo;s infrastructure that provided excellent protection from the previous days rain. With Captain &ldquo;Trucker&rdquo; Taylor winning the toss he typically elected to bat first.
Unfortunately the plan didn&rsquo;t pan out as hoped with both Wherwell openers falling in single figures.

      <br>
      Wherwell 1st XI travelled North to Donnington, a lovely setting though heavily affected by the bad weather the pitch whilst flat was clearly going to present a challenge for batters. Therefore when the toss was won by the home side there was no surprise when they asked Wherwell to bat.
Craig Beckingham and Jeremy Wickham made a slow but solid start under testing conditions, the outfield being slow meant boundaries were hard to find, Beckingham was first to depart for a gritty 17, this brought Stuart Taylor to the crease, it didn&rsquo;t take him long to settle and once in to his stride the slowness of the outfield was bypassed as the first match ball was lost, down a rabbit hole most likely, in a nearby field.
