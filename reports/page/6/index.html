      <br>
      KJM sponsored wherwell looked to get back to winning ways in there Sunday friendly against Southampton warriors. Captain Alex Gladwyn won the toss and decided to bat first. Wherwell lost early wickets and after 8 overs were 27 for 3, this brought together inform Stuart Taylor and captain Gladwyn, both batsman batted well and put together an 85 run partnership before Gladwyn departed for 36. Taylor held the innings together striking some lusty blows before being bowled for 96 trying to smash his way to his 5th 100 this season but got Wherwell to good total of 224.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored made the short journey to London Road 2 pitch, to find a wicket that looked dull and lifeless, After winning the toss Wherwell inserted their hosts and with no real back bone to their innings Andover soon collapsed away as Wherwell took wickets at regular intervals bowled out there hosts for just 117, with the pick of bowlers Mark Pettman 3-25, Stuart Taylor 2-15 and Matt Guilfoyle 2-20.

      <br>
      Both teams went into the game knowing it was going to be a real close one. KJM sponsored Wherwell in true tradition lost the toss and were asked to bat. Craig Beckingham and Stuart Taylor opened the batting and faced a some good lines and lengths from Robin Richards and Robbie Taylor. A smart catch by Stewart Clackson seen the end of Craig Beckingham, Taylor got a lifeline when bowled from a no-ball, he would go one to punish the bowlers for this mistake.

      <br>
      With the forecast of heavy rain KJM sponsored Wherwell made the journey to Minstead in the New Forest not expecting to get much cricket played against a Cadnam side sitting alongside the visitors in the league. Suprisingly the game got underway on time under leaden skies with Wherwell invited to bat on what looked a traditional strip with plenty of grass and a few hoof prints fortunately well short of a length.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell travelled to Compton looking to make it back to back wins in this fragmented season. Overnight rain had caught out the home side and the covers had not been used meaning there was a drying surface making the idea of bowling first highly inviting. Nathan Young called correct and had no hesitation inviting the home side to bat.
Stuart Taylor and Craig Beckingham took the new ball and immediately batting looked difficult with inconsistent bounce and pace troubling the batters, it was Taylor who made the breakthrough having the open adjudged caught behind with the score struggling to stay ahead of the overs, a brief flurry from the home side number 4 pushed the scoring rate to nearly 3 an over and the home side looked set for a reasonable score with wickets in hand but Wherwells change bowlers were all on song and the home side stalled and stuttered from 51 for 2 to 106 all out.

      <br>
      With summer finally making a show KJM sponsored Wherwell 1st XI travelled to play Compton &amp; Chandlers Ford, the ground looking perfect set as it is amongst a private development and benefitting from significant recent investments in it&rsquo;s infrastructure that provided excellent protection from the previous days rain. With Captain &ldquo;Trucker&rdquo; Taylor winning the toss he typically elected to bat first.
Unfortunately the plan didn&rsquo;t pan out as hoped with both Wherwell openers falling in single figures.

      <br>
      Wherwell 1st XI travelled North to Donnington, a lovely setting though heavily affected by the bad weather the pitch whilst flat was clearly going to present a challenge for batters. Therefore when the toss was won by the home side there was no surprise when they asked Wherwell to bat.
Craig Beckingham and Jeremy Wickham made a slow but solid start under testing conditions, the outfield being slow meant boundaries were hard to find, Beckingham was first to depart for a gritty 17, this brought Stuart Taylor to the crease, it didn&rsquo;t take him long to settle and once in to his stride the slowness of the outfield was bypassed as the first match ball was lost, down a rabbit hole most likely, in a nearby field.

Craig Sams came to the crease. Trebert and Sams made and excellent start Trebert being bowled on 36 with Sams pushing on to achieve his first every century with 108 not out. Wherwell finishing with 179 on the board.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell travelled to Farley as the fixture list made a home &amp; away double for the 2 clubs. Winning the toss on a flat looking strip the visitors chose to field first. With a strong youth contingent in the side Wherwell looked to contain the home team who, knowing the short boundaries square of the wicket, were keen to chase width. The home batters tried hard to get out but Wherwell were not willing to accept the opportunities.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell 2nd XI travelled to the picturesque ground of Farley on a blazing hot day.
With many players unavailable or called into the 1st XI it was very much a makeshift team that won the toss and elected to field much to the home teams surprise.
Robbie Skeates (10-19-2) opened the bowling down the hill and it was soon apparent that the wicket offered much for the new ball as it flew off the many dents left from previous use in the damp weather.
