      <br>
      Wherwell IIâ€™s skip Cray Sams won the toss and skipped C Sams decided to bowl.
Rob Gladwyn opened the bowling with a wicket maiden giving Wherwell II a good start. The pitch was a difficult one for Winterslow IIâ€™s openers to gain momentum as Wherwell kept the fielding tight and with tactical rollers and bouncers, but the bowling extras relieved some of the pressure. New comer Rob White came onto bowl breaking the developing partnership of Winterslow IIâ€™s and created a good opportunity to regain the match at 98 for 2 off 20.

      <br>
      Wherwell made the journey to Promotion chasing Bishops Waltham on a gloriously sunny summers day knowing that the chance of promotion had likely slipped by for another year but still with plenty of positives to play for.
Skipper for the day, Alex Gladwyn, won the toss and elected to bowl first under the clear skies on what looked to be a cracking strip much to the bemusement of his team. However once the opening bowlers got loose it proved an inspired decision both Emslie and Taylor bowled with great control and were backed up in the field with Charlie Ingrem in particular excelling at cover.
