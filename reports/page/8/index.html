      <br>
      If you don&rsquo;t like what you see here get the Trucks out!
KJM sponsored Wherwell hosted Amesbury on what can only be described a scorchingly hot day. The wicket for the first time this season was dry, and after winning the toss the visiting skipper Dale Gower had no hesitation in bowling first. Wherwell started slowly trying to build a score. Beckingham (9) and Wickham (16) stayed put seen off the original scare in the first 5 overs.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell hosted AWE Tadley on a damp strip. Losing the toss Wherwell were asked to bat. Stuart Taylor was dropped in the third over and this proved costly as he went on to punish the visitors scoring 76, unfortunately only Elton Adamo offered real support with a well crafted 32 as the home side labored to 167 all out. In reply Craig Beckingham was given the opportunity to open the bowling and his tight lines forced a early run out.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell entertained a strong Bramshaw side, after losing the toss the visitors decided to have a bat knowing Wherwell had just ten, but started with just nine due to the late arrival of a player. So with just nine Wherwell knew it was going to tough to stem the runs. Bramshaw&rsquo;s top order began to find the boundaries with ease in particular T.Vane 101 and C.Plumbury 65 really took a liking to the bowling, however Adam Cook 5-27 of 7 overs ensured Wherwell had a chance, but after a huge 256 all out Bramshaw went to tea knowing that the total was above anything Wherwell had scored all season.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell lost the toss and were invited to bat first, with a strong side and on the back of 2 wins there was a positive feeling in the dressing room that unfortunately didn’t last long. Faced with steady bowlers looking for nothing more than line and length bowling the batsmen just surrendered. Only Mick Ling with 17 threatened to hang around but succumbed to a straight ball that he pulled to the fielder at square Leg with unerring accuracy.

      <br>
      Wherwell 2nd XI hosted Cadnam, for the first time in a fortnight the pitch was deemed to be playable. Mick Ling batted first opening with Jordan Trebert. the pair got off to the perfect start with Jordan in T20 mode, he raced to 50 runs with Ling matching him, they put on 112 before Jordan lost his wicket, his elder brother Luke batting at 3 provided a foil for the classic style of Ling as they took the score to 130 for 1 before Trebert fell for 18.

      <br>
      A depleted 2nds team took on Centurions. With only a few bowlers available the task was always going to be tough. Brendan Tasker 43-2, Rob Weeks 47-2 and Charles Ingram 3runs -4 wickets were the pick of the bowlers as they bowled them out for 163. In reply Wherwell started well with Mick Ling (28) and Nigel Horne 68 not out, (first ever league 50) providing a foundation for which Wherwell hoped to kick on but unfortunately it wasn&rsquo;t to be as they fell 8runs short of the target.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell hosted Crown Taverners in a mid table clash. Wherwell won the toss and elected to bowl on a flat batting strip knowing using the new ball would be key and so it proved. Stuart Taylor 3-32 and Christian Nicel 2-20 opened the bowling and bowled tight lines creating chances by keeping the run rate down. Both picked up wickets in first few overs as the pace proved too much.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwells good start to the season came to a grinding halt against Dinton as the batsman went missing in the sun. Wherwell posted a well below par 110 all out from 33 overs. Knowing it would be very difficult to defend Wherwell had to attack from the off. A wicket in the 3rd over got Wherwells hopes up but that was to be it till Dinton had all but won the won game.

      <br>
      Kjm sponosred wherwell got there season off to a flyer by producing a great team display. Losing the toss Wherwell were ask to bat on a very green strip. Staurt &ldquo;Trucker&quot;Taylor (11) and new opening partner Ed John (10)set the tone as the dug deep and kept the new ball out for 10 overs. Ed John miss-timed a ball and that popped up to mid on. This brought a mini collapse as Taylor and Beckingham soon followed.

      <br>
      On the rare occasion this season of a sunny Saturday KJM sponsored Wherwell entertained Farley at a dry but soft playing Fields ground. Having lost the toss Wherwell were asked to bowl, with a young side Dan Pawley and Harry Trebert were entrusted the new ball and both bowled with good control but it was the introduction of Mick Ling that brought the first wicket with a well taken catch by Rory Griffin at fine leg, Griffin bowled unchanged through 10 overs and was unrewarded despite bowling a consistent line and finishing with only 27 runs from his 10.
