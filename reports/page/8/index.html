      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell 1st XI travelled to Midhurst in West Sussex. Wherwell won the toss and bowled first. Midhurst scored 139 all out on a damp surface, S Lush top scoring with 66. Stuart Taylor 3-30 Matt Guilfoyle 3-21 Nathan Young 2 -22 Christian Nicel 1-14 were the wicket takers. In reply Stuart Taylor 11 Nathan Young 30 opened the batting getting Wherwell off to a good start with contributions from Elton Adamo 21 Alex Gladwyn 35no Dave Langford 15 and Matt Guilfoyle 11no saw Wherwell comfortably home to the total and ending up on 140-4.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell always knew this trip would be a tough one and so it proved under the blazing sun they were asked to bat first on what looked a good track. Taylor and John started well but both fell as the pitch showed some variable pace and bounce. Once again indiscipline showed as the middle order got them selves out with a combination of poor shot choice and bad luck.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell travelled to sparsholt wondering how much of a game would get played as the grey clouds threatened to halt play again. Losing the toss they were asked to bat on a very hard green wicket. Starting with intent Jez Wickman and Ed John built a steady opening partnership scoring all round the wicket. Ed John (13) started to look in form before squaring himself up in front of all 3 stumps for a easy LBW decision.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell travelled into Wiltshire to play against Steeple Langford. Both skippers knowing the toss was crucial. Wherwell lost it and were made to bowl. Christian Nicel got a early breakthrough but it was always going to tough fielding first in the heat on a lovely batting track. Steeple Langford built a total as they started shifting through the gears going from 90-2 from 27 overs to 270-6 from 45.

      <br>
      Wherwell seconds travelled to Verwood when a trip to the beach might have been more appropriate. With only 10 players able to travel there was relief when the toss was won and Wherwell elected to bat on a beautiful looking strip. Early wickets came as no surprise but in the midst of a below par batting performance there were some good knocks from Cray Sams, Harry Trebert, Stephen Bonser and Nigel Horne, all making double figures but managing to find a way to get out.

      <br>
      If you don&rsquo;t like what you see here get the Trucks out!
KJM sponsored Wherwell hosted Amesbury on what can only be described a scorchingly hot day. The wicket for the first time this season was dry, and after winning the toss the visiting skipper Dale Gower had no hesitation in bowling first. Wherwell started slowly trying to build a score. Beckingham (9) and Wickham (16) stayed put seen off the original scare in the first 5 overs.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell hosted AWE Tadley on a damp strip. Losing the toss Wherwell were asked to bat. Stuart Taylor was dropped in the third over and this proved costly as he went on to punish the visitors scoring 76, unfortunately only Elton Adamo offered real support with a well crafted 32 as the home side labored to 167 all out. In reply Craig Beckingham was given the opportunity to open the bowling and his tight lines forced a early run out.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell entertained a strong Bramshaw side, after losing the toss the visitors decided to have a bat knowing Wherwell had just ten, but started with just nine due to the late arrival of a player. So with just nine Wherwell knew it was going to tough to stem the runs. Bramshaw&rsquo;s top order began to find the boundaries with ease in particular T.Vane 101 and C.Plumbury 65 really took a liking to the bowling, however Adam Cook 5-27 of 7 overs ensured Wherwell had a chance, but after a huge 256 all out Bramshaw went to tea knowing that the total was above anything Wherwell had scored all season.

      <br>
      KJM sponsored Wherwell lost the toss and were invited to bat first, with a strong side and on the back of 2 wins there was a positive feeling in the dressing room that unfortunately didn’t last long. Faced with steady bowlers looking for nothing more than line and length bowling the batsmen just surrendered. Only Mick Ling with 17 threatened to hang around but succumbed to a straight ball that he pulled to the fielder at square Leg with unerring accuracy.

      <br>
      Wherwell 2nd XI hosted Cadnam, for the first time in a fortnight the pitch was deemed to be playable. Mick Ling batted first opening with Jordan Trebert. the pair got off to the perfect start with Jordan in T20 mode, he raced to 50 runs with Ling matching him, they put on 112 before Jordan lost his wicket, his elder brother Luke batting at 3 provided a foil for the classic style of Ling as they took the score to 130 for 1 before Trebert fell for 18.
