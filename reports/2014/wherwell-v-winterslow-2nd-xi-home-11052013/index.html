<meta property="og:description" content="Following the wet 2012 season it was no surprise that the 2013 season started with rain in the air and a soft pitch. With a strong wind blowing straight up the ground Wherwell fielded first and initial exchanges were favoring the home side, Charlie Ingram and Harry Trebert bowled good lines and kept the batsmen honest but without success as the chances offered early were not taken. The first 12 overs went slowly supported by rain and wind but the change of bowling added momentum to the batting side, Mick Ling introduced himself to bowl into the teeth of a strong blow and immediately found the line difficult to control, after a watchful first over consisting of 10 balls the Winterslow opening batsman cut loose hitting hard to the on-side and within 4 overs had gone from 20 to 50 despite loosing his young opening partner." />

						<p>Following the wet 2012 season it was no surprise that the 2013 season started with rain in the air and a soft pitch. With a strong wind blowing straight up the ground Wherwell fielded first and initial exchanges were favoring the home side, Charlie Ingram and Harry Trebert bowled good lines and kept the batsmen honest but without success as the chances offered early were not taken. The first 12 overs went slowly supported by rain and wind but the change of bowling added momentum to the batting side, Mick Ling introduced himself to bowl into the teeth of a strong blow and immediately found the line difficult to control, after a watchful first over consisting of 10 balls the Winterslow opening batsman cut loose hitting hard to the on-side and within 4 overs had gone from 20 to 50 despite loosing his young opening partner. With the 1st XI sat watching from the pavilion having found their opposition unwilling to play Nathan Young had managed to win the bun fight to play in the 2nds and came down the hill with his off cutters, his 10 overs were the only bowling highlight taking 4 for 28 as the visitors finished on 189 for 6.</p>
<p>Wherwell as a batting side never really got started, in fact it was ironic that on a damp pitch &ldquo;ducks&rdquo; were plentiful, only the talented Jacob Williams (more to come this season) with 15 and Craig Sams with 17 got the home team into the batting points as they were rolled over for a disappointing 50. The positives for most of the home batters, &ldquo;it can only get better!&rdquo;</p>
