						<p>1st XI sign off with Thunder and Lightening.</p>
<p>Aptly for this summer Wherwell were forced to play a home game on a neighbours ground under leaden skies with rain forecast. Whilst many games were called off Wherwell debated how to get the mower going so that the pitch would be more suitable for cricket rather than a picnic, unfortunately whilst they pondered this the unthinkable happened, Captain Dave Langford won the toss!</p>
<p>So the mower was obsoleted and Wherwell elected to field knowing that a maximum points win could see them finish in the top 10. Christian Nicel and Stuart Taylor continued their partnership with the new ball and quckly were amongst the wickets as the visiting Sparsholt batsmen struggled to cope with the swing and pace. A passing thunderstorm shortened the match meaning the maximum points win would be difficult so Wherwell just set about going for the jugular.</p>
<p>Stuart Taylor bowled a rain interrupted 3 overs taking 1 for 4, his partner in crime Nicel was the most successful taking 4 for 34 from 9 (should have been 5, sorry!) but the change bowlers were just as destructive with Matt Guilfoyle taking 2 for 5 from 8 and Nathan Young finishing things off with 3 for 30 from 3.5. Sparsholt were all out for 77 having only used 24 overs.</p>
<p>The rain meant that Wherwell had only 27 overs but the score revised down to 57 looked well within their capabilities. Taylor opened the batting and looked in the mood to finish things in the fewest number of balls, having tried to hit a six from Hurstbourne to Longparish (nearly made it!) he was run out for a quick fire 20, 2 subsequent quick wickets fell as batsmen tried to bully the attack and may have caused a panic on another day but this was different, Captain Langford (16 n.o) was joined by Guilfoyle (12n.o) who with the words of encouragement from the Sparsholt Fielders ringing in his ears hit the first ball he faced for a handsome 6 to follow his first ball success when bowling earlier. Not to be outdone even Langford managed a straight 6! ( I saw it, it did  happen&hellip;).</p>
<p>Wherwell reached their target of only 5.5 overs courtesy of 2 wides to complete a somewhat disjointed season and ended 11th in County Div 4 North which considering that 4 seasons ago they were in RD3NW is to be considered a fine achievement.</p>
