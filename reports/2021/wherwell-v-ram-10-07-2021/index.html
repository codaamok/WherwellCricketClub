						<p>I let it fall, my heart, And as it fell, you rose to claim it<br/>
It was dark and I was over, Until you kissed my lips and you saved me<br/>
My hands, they were strong, But my knees were far too weak<br/>
To stand in your arms, Without falling to your feet<br/>
But there&rsquo;s a side to you, That I never knew, never knew<br/>
All the things you&rsquo;d say, They were never true, never true<br/>
And the games you&rsquo;d play, You would always win, always win<br/>
Set Fire to the Rain ~ Adele<br/></p>
<p>‘You miss 100% of shots you don’t take’ ~ Wayne Gretzky</p>
<p>And I am not talking about the game here, I’m talking about all the prep and hard work that goes in every week to get games of cricket on. At 10am it looked like the rain was going to ruin another weekend. But the Wherwell ground team were not going to be beaten easily, the rain was stopping, the sun was about to break through the clouds. They took their shot and the game was on!</p>
<p>Wherwell won the toss and put Ram into bat, the bowlers are insatiable for wickets and wanted to keep the tally count rocketing upwards. And it didn’t take long for the 17th best bowler (according to last weeks national honours board) in the country to strike again. Vokes (2-10) once again was miserly off his 8 and with Emslie (2-32) picking up an early wicket as well Ram found themselves 3 down. Ram needed a partnership, but Cutts (3-20) had other ideas using pace and aggression to burst through defenses and blowing a kiss to his victims. Young (1-35) and Skeates (1-11) both teased a batsman into  false shot and found the waiting Fell adding two more grabs to hit record.. but the catch of the day came towards the end of the Ram innings, a tailender slog, a steepling ball out to cow corner and a confident Trebert.J under it taking it with ease. Next ball was a run out and the innings was done. 112 ao</p>
<p>Chases like these are never easy. There was still something in the pitch for the bowlers and Ram started with good pace and bowled tight lines. But the Wherwell defense was solid and was only undone by a top delivery. Ram needed quick wickets now, but Skeates (25) and Cooke (38*) had other ideas putting up a wall and seeing off the opening attack. Ram mixed up the bowling to try and force a way in as the rain started to fall. Wherwell were ahead of the rate at the 20 over mark and could have come off but having done everything to Get the Game On it was fitting to finish what we started. RAM did manage one more wicket but Gladwyn (16* - are we sure this is right?!) helped kill off any chance off a collapse.</p>
<p>It is getting tight at the top and Wherwell show no signs of easing off.</p>
