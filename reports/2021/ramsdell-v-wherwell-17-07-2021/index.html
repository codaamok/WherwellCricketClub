<p>Our regular wordsmith believes that a kite before the the game is good luck, goodness knows what he would have made of 7 of the beasts flying high. Down on the ground the track was a belter and the weather was hot. The coin went up and Stand in Skipper Skeates called correct. Wherwell were making first use of track. With the master plan of ‘bat the 40’ ringing in their ears the opening pair of J Trebert and Wyatt Fell made a steady start before Trebert fell trying to flick the miserly Morley (1-9) around the corner bringing Skeates (38) to the crease. The pair found batting tough in the face of such consistent bowling. Wherwell found themselves with 80-3 off 24, first part of the mantra a success. Wherwell needed to tear the handbrake off if a defendable target was possible and they don’t come better than Bradley Dawes, AKA horse (29) and Michael David Cutts. The fielders became ball boys as the teeing off began. Cutts was ably supported by Foord (20),Young (16) and H Trebert (2*). A superb innings of numbers; 12 (Twelve) maximums, 5 boundary fours and not many dot balls propelled the Wherwell slugger to 120*. One of, if not, the best hundred many of us have seen. Wherwell made 258 from their 40.</p>
<p>The scene was set. You know the story so far this season; JV 0-not many, Mike to snag an opener, Nathan and Dawes to chip away, wherwell to win by plenty. Job done. However, Ramsdell and particularly their captain had other ideas….</p>
<p>With runs on the board it was always gonna be the bowler’s job to take the 10 wickets for the full point victory. The usually inexpensive J vokes (3-49) removed the openers and then the number 4 with an unplayable delivery pinning back off stump before feeding the captain, J Bradley’s straight drive searching for his wicket. It wasn’t to come. When Dawes (1-50) picked up another wicket Ramsdell were at 108-4 off 15. Well up with the rate. What should’ve been a formality was turning into everyone’s nightmare. The heat was sapping and Ramsdell were one partnership and one Captain’s Knock away from securing a famous win. Given a reprieve in the 50’s when N Young (2-32) Stephen Finn’d the stumps before bowling him, it took the man of the moment M Cutts (3-19) to blow the partnership to pieces with a brutal double wicket over, sending the middle stump of J Bradley’s flying and ending his fine knock of 82 and then the leg stump of his replacement. Wherwell were in the ascendency with debutant A Pratt (1-12) getting in on the act before the game was fittingly brought to a close by Cuttsy, this time completing the set by pinning back off stump. Wherwell ended up winning by 62 Runs. It’s now extremely tight at the top but wherwell have snuck in 2nd place. Wherwell entertain Hook and Newham Basic 3rd XI with a chance to cement a place in the top 2.</p>
