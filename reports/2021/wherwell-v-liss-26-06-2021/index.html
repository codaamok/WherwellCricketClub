						<p>On the first part of the journey, I was looking at all the life<br/>
There were plants and birds and rocks and things, There was sand and hills and rings<br/>
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz, And the sky with no clouds<br/>
The heat was hot, and the ground was dry, But the air was full of sound<br/>
I&rsquo;ve been through the desert…<br/></p>
<p>No one likes to see a club struggling for numbers, especially one established in 1880, so all credit to Liss for turning up to honour the fixture even though they had to start with 10.</p>
<p>Things started well enough as each of the Liss opening bowlers hitting the stumps and reducing Wherwell to 38-2. Wherwell responded in standard fashion with a succession of mini partnerships pushing the run rate up with each successive dismissal. 38-2 became 60-3 with Skeates (28) being sawn off by his partner. Emslie (22) next to go leaving Wherwell on a familiar 88-4. The middle order fired a little better than previous weeks, with M Cutts (39) running hard and Holewell (60) hitting hard and straight. Dawes (23) then came in for a blazing cameo, but not enough for maximum batting points with a tight spell from Hedicker (3-20). Wherwell finished 211-9.</p>
<p>Liss put up stout resistance to the Wherwell opening attack. In so doing they struggled to score runs which allowed the spinners to come and bowl to aggressive fields. Young (3-25) once again in the wickets hitting the stumps three times – shame he can’t complete a caught and bowled.. Dawes (2-14) was unplayable at times (6 maidens) and removed the Liss key batsman Harfield (35). Skeates (1-19) will feel like he deserved more with the ball having had the drop of the decade off his first ball – Gladwyn being undone by the lack of pace. A couple of wickets for the returning Emslie (2-19) and Liss finished 102ao.</p>
<p>23 points scored and the performances are improving week on week, need to raise it again for Farley away next week.</p>
